title: "Simple Quarto Website Template"
---

This is a Quarto Website template that I like to use. It is easily modified, but contains a few important features that I often want to repeat!

- The jekyll template (which can be pesky when working with GitHub pages) is already disabled
- Templates for drop-down menus are provided
- Google Analytics is set up for you to use, along with a pop-up for user consent! To use Google Analytics:
  - Sign up for a Google Analytics Account
  - Create a stream for this website
  - Add your Google Analytics Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX) to two lines of code found in `privacypolicy/google-analytics.html`. 
  - Update your contact information at `privacypolicy/privacy.qmd`
- If you don't want to track your analytics, remove the last two lines of code in `_quarto.yml` (`include-in-header: privacypolicy/google-analytics.html` and `include-after-body: privacypolicy/custom-popup.html` can be deleted)


This page (`index.qmd`) is your Home Page.
