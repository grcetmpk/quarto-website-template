title: "Page 2"
subtitle: "Subtitle for Page 2"
date-modified: last-modified

This is a sample page that's a bit more fancy. It has a subtitle, and the last date the page was modified appears using `date-modified: last-modified` in the preamble of this page.

Just like in RMarkdown, I can add:

-   images

-   tables

-   lists

-   LaTex

-   Code Chunks

-   ... and more!

If you're using RStudio, the visual mode (see button on the top left) can be helpful with adding extra features!

## More cool features

I really like to add drop-down menus for teaching! These are called "callout" blocks. In visual mode, you can find them under the "Insert" drop down menu, near the bottom.

## This is a drop-down menu. Click it to read more!

Surprise!

I often imbed YouTube videos in my webpages, too. You can easily add them using `{{< video [VIDEO LINK]>}}`.
